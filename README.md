# Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing
---
This README file is to explain what I did in each file of this repository.
---
**This is a new repository that I created to share my code in the CS50x computer science course by Harvard University.
This is not the same repository used in the course, as that one is made private by Harvard, so it cannot be shared.**
In this repository, I have compiled the assignments(or problem sets) that I have submitted so far into the course.

The descriptions for each project/file are below.
However, you can also view the instructions for the homework in the CS50x course to understand what each assignment or problem set requires, using the links.

Week 1
- mario: print out a half-pyramid(in the mario game) which has a height according to the input number
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/mario.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/mario/less/
- cash: using the "Greedy Algorithm" to calculate the least number of coins(25c, 10c, ...) that needs to be given back as a change
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/cash.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/cash/
- credit: using Luhn's Algorithm as a "checksum" to detect fraudulent credit card numbers without searching in the database
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/credit.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/credit/ 

Week 2
- readability: using Coleman-Liau index to decide what is  the suitable age for each book, or text, according to length and complexity
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/readability.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/readability/
- caesar: using Caesar's encryption to convert plaintext into ciphertext(to send secret messages) by shifting letters
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/caesar.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/caesar/

Week 3
- plurality: create a voting system using the plurality system(winner takes all)
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/plurality.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/plurality/
- runoff: create a runoff voting system where there is a ranked choice(each voter has first, second, and third preference)
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/runoff.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/runoff/

Week 4
- filter: using the idea of bitmaps, create a programme that filters the input image into greyscale, sepia, reflection, and blurred images
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/tree/main/filter-less
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/filter/less/
- recover: a programme that recovers deleted JPEG files from memory card, opens up a new file, and writes the recovered JPEG into it using malloc wihout memory leaks
   - my work: https://github.com/holybirder/Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing/blob/main/recover.c
   - assignment instructions: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/recover/
