# Compiled--Portfolio-for-H2-Computing
---
This README file is to explain what I did in each file of this repository.
---
**This is a new repository that I created to share my code in the CS50x computer science course by Harvard University.
This is not the same repository used in the course, as that one is made private by Harvard, so it cannot be shared.**
In this repository, I have compiled the assignments(or problem sets) that I have submitted so far into the course.

The descriptions for each project/file are below.
However, you can also view the instructions for the homework in the CS50x course to understand what each assignment or problem set requires, using the links.

Week 1
- mario: print out a half-pyramid(in the mario game) which has a height according to the input number https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/mario/less/
- cash: using the "Greedy Algorithm" to calculate the least number of coins(25c, 10c, ...) that needs to be given back as a change https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/cash/
- credit: using Luhn's Algorithm as a "checksum" to detect fraudulent credit card numbers without searching in the database https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/1/credit/ 

Week 2
- readability: using Coleman-Liau index to decide what is  the suitable age for each book, or text, according to length and complexity https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/readability/
- caesar: using Caesar's encryption to convert plaintext into ciphertext(to send secret messages) by shifting letters https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/2/caesar/

Week 3
- plurality: create a voting system using the plurality system(winner takes all) https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/plurality/
- runoff: create a runoff voting system where there is a ranked choice(each voter has first, second, and third preference) https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/3/runoff/

Week 4
- filter: using the idea of bitmaps, create a programme that filters the input image into greyscale, sepia, reflection, and blurred images https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/filter/less/
- recover: a programme that recovers deleted JPEG files from memory card, opens up a new file, and writes the recovered JPEG into it using malloc wihout memory leaks https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/4/recover/
